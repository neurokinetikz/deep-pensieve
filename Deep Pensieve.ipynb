    "Variational auto-encoder (VAE) is a powerful unsupervised learning framework for image generation. One drawback of VAE is that it generates blurry images due to its Gaussianity assumption and thus L2 loss. To allow the generation of high quality images by VAE, we increase the capacity of decoder network by employing residual blocks and skip connections, which also enable efficient optimization. To overcome the limitation of L2 loss, we propose to generate images in a multi-stage manner from coarse to fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, the proposed multi-stage VAE divides the decoder into two components in which the second component generates refined images based on the course images generated by the first component. Since the second component is independent of the VAE model, it can employ other loss functions beyond the L2 loss and different model architectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed framework can be easily generalized to contain more than two components. Experiment results on the MNIST and CelebA datasets demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage VAE can generate sharper images as compared to those from the original VAE."

    "Convolutional networks for image classification progressively reduce resolution until the image is represented by tiny feature maps in which the spatial structure of the scene is no longer discernible. Such loss of spatial acuity can limit image classification accuracy and complicate the transfer of the model to downstream applications that require detailed scene understanding. These problems can be alleviated by dilation, which increases the resolution of output feature maps without reducing the receptive field of individual neurons. We show that dilated residual networks (DRNs) outperform their non-dilated counterparts in image classification without increasing the model’s depth or complexity"

[11, 12] first introduced the residual network for training much deeper network architectures and achieved superior performance. In particular, they showed that skip connection and recursive convolution alleviate the burden of carrying identity information in the super-resolution network. Similarly to [20], Mao et al. [16] tackled the general image restoration problem with encoder-decoder networks and symmetric skip connections. In [16], they argue that those nested skip connections provide fast and improved convergence."

    "Recently, several models based on deep neural networks have achieved great success in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and computational performance for single image super-resolution. In these methods, the low resolution (LR) input image is upscaled to the high resolution (HR) space using a single filter, commonly bicubic interpolation, before reconstruction. This means that the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. \n",

    "In this paper, we present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of 1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this, we propose a novel CNN architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition, we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. By doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each feature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall SR operation. \n",

Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. \n",

    "In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. \n",
